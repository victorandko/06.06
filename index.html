    <p>A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events,
       recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).
       Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations,
       and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).
       A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or discourse),
       in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).
       The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example,
       the cat sat on the mat, or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works,
       diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.
       In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.
       As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling": thus narrative technique is the method of telling stories,
       and narrative poetry is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.
       Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings: this is called narrativity.</p>
